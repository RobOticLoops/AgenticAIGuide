# Contributing to Awesome Agentic AI

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project aims to be a comprehensive, community-driven guide to Agentic AI development, focusing on open-source and freely available resources. Your contributions are valuable in keeping it accurate, up-to-date, and exhaustive.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are several ways you can contribute:

*   **Reporting Issues:** If you find broken links, outdated information, or resources that no longer fit the criteria (e.g., are no longer free/open-source), please open an issue.
*   **Suggesting New Resources:** Found an awesome framework, tool, model, paper, or tutorial missing from the list? Please open an issue or submit a Pull Request.
*   **Improving Descriptions:** Think a description can be clearer or more informative? Suggest changes via an issue or PR.
*   **Adding Examples:** Contributions to the `examples/` directory (once created) demonstrating how to use these technologies are highly encouraged.
*   **Creating Guides:** Adding new technology guides under the `guides/` directory.

## Adding Items to the List (Pull Requests)

If you want to add a new item to the main `README.md` list:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Create a new branch** for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b add-new-framework`).
3.  **Add your resource** to the relevant section in `README.md`.
4.  **Maintain the format:** Please follow the existing format:
    *   `- **[Resource Name]:** Short description focusing on relevance to Agentic AI.`
    *   `  * **Description:** (Optional) More detailed description if needed.`
    *   `  * **Links:** [GitHub](link) | [Website](link) | [Documentation](link) | [Tutorials](link) | [YouTube](link) (Include relevant links)`
5.  **Ensure Relevance:** The resource should be directly related to building, deploying, evaluating, or understanding Agentic AI systems.
6.  **Prioritize Open Source & Free:** While important commercial platforms are included, the primary focus is on resources that are free to use (at least with a generous free tier) and preferably open-source. Clearly label managed services or those with significant costs.
7.  **Add a Corresponding Guide (Optional but Recommended):** If adding a major framework or tool, consider creating a corresponding guide file in the `/guides` directory (see below).
8.  **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message.
9.  **Push your branch** to your fork.
10. **Open a Pull Request** back to the main repository. Explain your changes clearly in the PR description.

## Adding Specific Technology Guides

If you wish to add a detailed guide for a specific technology:

1.  Follow the PR process above.
2.  Create a new Markdown file in the appropriate sub-directory under `/guides/`. For example, a guide for `XYZFramework` would go into `/guides/frameworks/xyzframework.md`. If a suitable category doesn't exist, feel free to suggest one.
3.  Include a brief overview of the technology and its key features relevant to Agentic AI.
4.  **Include a "LearnLM 1.5 Prompt":** Add a section with a prompt specifically designed to ask a powerful LLM (like our hypothetical "LearnLM 1.5") to generate a learning plan for that technology. Use the examples in existing guides as a template.
