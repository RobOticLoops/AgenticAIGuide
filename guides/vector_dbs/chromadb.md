# Learning Guide: ChromaDB

ChromaDB is a popular open-source embedding database designed specifically for AI applications. It makes it easy to store, manage, and retrieve vector embeddings, which is crucial for adding memory and knowledge (RAG) to Agentic AI systems.

**Key Concepts for Agentic AI:**
*   Embeddings: Understanding what vector embeddings are and how they represent data (text, images).
*   Collections: How Chroma organizes data.
*   Storing Data: Adding documents/text and their corresponding embeddings (or letting Chroma generate them).
*   Querying: Performing similarity searches to find relevant information based on a query vector.
*   Metadata Filtering: Refining searches based on associated metadata.
*   Client/Server vs. In-Memory: Understanding deployment options.
*   Integration: Using ChromaDB with frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex.

## LearnLM 1.5 Prompt: ChromaDB Learning Plan

*Copy and paste the following prompt into a powerful LLM like Google's LearnLM 1.5 (or similar advanced model) to generate a personalized learning plan.*

**Prompt:**

"Act as an expert AI curriculum designer focused on data infrastructure for AI. I am a Python developer building Agentic AI systems and need to understand how to implement long-term memory and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using vector databases.

My goal is to become proficient in using **ChromaDB** as the vector store for my AI agents.

Please generate a structured, step-by-step learning plan covering:

1.  **Vector Database Fundamentals:** Briefly explain vector embeddings, similarity search, and why vector databases are essential for AI memory/RAG.
2.  **ChromaDB Core Concepts:** Collections, embedding functions (using built-in or external ones like OpenAI/Hugging Face), adding documents (with text, IDs, metadata), and querying.
3.  **Practical Usage (Python Client):** Hands-on exercises using the ChromaDB Python client for creating collections, adding data, performing similarity searches, and filtering by metadata.
4.  **Embedding Functions:** Understanding how to configure and use different embedding models with Chroma.
5.  **Deployment Modes:** Explain the difference between running Chroma in-memory (persistent/transient) vs. client/server mode.
6.  **Integration with LLM Frameworks:** Show basic examples or point to resources on integrating ChromaDB as a VectorStore in LangChain and/or LlamaIndex for RAG pipelines or agent memory.
7.  **Scaling & Performance:** Briefly touch upon considerations for larger datasets (though detailed scaling might be advanced).
8.  **Project Ideas:** Suggest a simple project integrating ChromaDB, like building a basic RAG chatbot for a small set of documents.
9.  **Resource Mapping:** Link learning objectives to specific ChromaDB documentation pages (`docs.trychroma.com`), recipes, or key tutorials.

Structure the plan logically, focusing on practical Python examples relevant to integrating ChromaDB into an Agentic AI workflow."
