 # Learning Guide: Flowise

Flowise is an open-source, low-code UI tool for building customized LLM applications, including chatbots, RAG systems, and agents. It uses a drag-and-drop interface built on top of LangChainJS, allowing for rapid prototyping and visualization of LLM flows.

**Key Concepts for Agentic AI:**
*   Visual Flow Building: Understanding the drag-and-drop interface.
*   Nodes: Representing components like LLMs, Prompts, Tools, Vector Stores, Agents.
*   Chatflows: Designing conversational applications.
*   Agents & Tools: Incorporating LangChain agents and tools visually.
*   Vector Stores & RAG: Building RAG pipelines using visual components.
*   Deployment: Exporting and deploying Flowise applications.
*   Customization: Adding custom components or extending functionality.

## LearnLM 1.5 Prompt: Flowise Learning Plan

*Copy and paste the following prompt into a powerful LLM like Google's LearnLM 1.5 (or similar advanced model) to generate a personalized learning plan.*

**Prompt:**

"Act as an expert AI curriculum designer specializing in low-code AI development tools. I am interested in rapidly prototyping and building LLM applications like chatbots and simple agents without writing extensive code initially. I have a basic understanding of LLM concepts (prompts, RAG, agents).

My goal is to learn how to use **Flowise** effectively to visually build, test, and deploy LLM-powered applications and agentic workflows.

Please generate a structured, step-by-step learning plan covering:

1.  **Flowise Introduction:** Understanding the UI, core concepts (Nodes, Edges, Chatflows), and its relationship to LangChainJS.
2.  **Installation & Setup:** Getting Flowise running locally (e.g., via Docker or Node.js).
3.  **Building Basic Chatbots:** Creating simple conversational flows using LLM nodes and prompt templates.
4.  **Implementing RAG:** Building a RAG pipeline by integrating document loaders, text splitters, embedding models, and vector store nodes (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone).
5.  **Creating Simple Agents:** Incorporating pre-built LangChain agent nodes (like Conversational Agent, ReAct Agent) and connecting tools (e.g., Calculator, Search APIs).
6.  **Using Tools:** Adding and configuring tool nodes (SerpAPI, Calculator, custom tools via API nodes).
7.  **Saving & Loading Chatflows:** Managing your created applications.
8.  **Deployment Options:** Understanding how to embed Flowise chatflows or potentially deploy them as APIs.
9.  **Exploring Marketplaces & Custom Nodes:** Finding pre-built templates and understanding how to potentially add custom functionality.
10. **Project Ideas:** Suggest 1-2 simple projects that are well-suited for Flowise (e.g., a customer support chatbot over specific FAQs, a simple research assistant using a search tool).
11. **Resource Mapping:** Link learning objectives to specific Flowise documentation sections, tutorials (especially the official YouTube channel), or relevant nodes within the UI.

Structure the plan logically, focusing on hands-on activities within the Flowise interface."
