# Learning Guide: RAGAs

RAGAs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment) is an open-source Python framework focused specifically on evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. It provides a set of metrics that assess the performance of different components of your RAG system (retrieval and generation) without relying solely on ground truth labels.

**Key Concepts for Agentic AI/RAG:**
*   RAG Pipeline Evaluation: The importance of evaluating both the retrieval and generation components.
*   Reference-Free Metrics: Many RAGAs metrics aim to evaluate quality without needing manually crafted "perfect" answers.
*   Core Metrics:
    *   **Context Precision:** Measures signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved contexts.
    *   **Context Recall:** Measures the ability of the retriever to fetch all necessary context.
    *   **Faithfulness:** Measures how factually consistent the generated answer is with the provided context.
    *   **Answer Relevancy:** Measures how relevant the generated answer is to the original question.
    *   (Other metrics like Context Relevance, Answer Semantic Similarity, Answer Correctness may also be relevant).
*   Evaluation Workflow: Preparing datasets (question, contexts, answer, ground truth [optional]), running evaluations, interpreting scores.
*   LLM-as-Judge: RAGAs often uses LLMs to compute its metrics.

## LearnLM 1.5 Prompt: RAGAs Learning Plan

*Copy and paste the following prompt into a powerful LLM like Google's LearnLM 1.5 (or similar advanced model) to generate a personalized learning plan.*

**Prompt:**

"Act as an expert AI curriculum designer specializing in the evaluation of LLM applications, particularly Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). I am a Python developer building RAG systems (likely using frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex) and need a robust way to measure their performance beyond simple accuracy.

My goal is to learn how to use the **RAGAs** framework effectively to evaluate the quality of my RAG pipelines, focusing on both the retrieval and generation aspects.

Please generate a structured, step-by-step learning plan covering:

1.  **RAG Evaluation Challenges:** Why evaluating RAG is complex and the limitations of traditional metrics.
2.  **RAGAs Introduction:** Core philosophy (evaluating components, reference-free metrics) and key metrics (Context Precision, Context Recall, Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy). Explain what each metric measures conceptually.
3.  **Setup & Data Format:** Installing RAGAs and preparing the evaluation dataset (minimum requirements: question, answer, contexts; optional: ground_truth). Understanding the expected data structure (e.g., Hugging Face Datasets format).
4.  **Running Evaluations:** Using the `ragas.evaluate` function with the prepared dataset and selected metrics. Configuring the LLM used for evaluation (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI).
5.  **Interpreting Scores:** Understanding the meaning of the scores for each metric (typically 0 to 1) and how they reflect pipeline performance.
6.  **Metric Deep Dive:** Explore the nuances of each core metric â€“ how it's calculated (conceptually, using LLM-as-judge) and what aspects of the RAG pipeline it assesses.
7.  **Integrating RAGAs:** How to integrate RAGAs evaluation into a development workflow (e.g., after building/modifying a RAG pipeline).
8.  **Limitations & Considerations:** Understanding the reliance on LLM-as-judge, potential costs, and when metrics might be less reliable.
9.  **Practical Example:** Walk through a hypothetical evaluation run for a simple RAG system.
10. **Resource Mapping:** Link learning objectives to specific RAGAs documentation pages (getting started, metrics, explanations), example notebooks, or relevant blog posts.

Structure the plan logically, emphasizing understanding the metrics and applying them practically using the Python library."
