# Learning Guide: LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex is a data framework designed specifically for building context-aware LLM applications, excelling particularly in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It provides tools for data ingestion, indexing, querying, and integration into LLM workflows and agents.

**Key Concepts for Agentic AI:**
*   Data Connectors: Ingesting data from various sources (APIs, files, databases).
*   Indexing: Structuring data for efficient retrieval (Vector Stores, Summaries, Knowledge Graphs).
*   Retrievers: Fetching relevant context based on a query.
*   Query Engines: Answering questions over your data using retrieval and LLMs.
*   Agents: Building agents that leverage LlamaIndex's data capabilities for reasoning and tool use (often complementary to LangChain agents).
*   Observability & Evaluation: Tools for tracking and evaluating RAG pipeline performance.
