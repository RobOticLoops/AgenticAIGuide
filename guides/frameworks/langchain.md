# Learning Guide: LangChain

LangChain is a comprehensive framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides modular components for connecting LLMs to data sources, interacting with environments, and building complex chains and agents.

**Key Concepts for Agentic AI:**
*   Models (LLMs, Chat Models, Embeddings)
*   Prompts (Templates, Management, Optimization)
*   Chains (Sequences of calls, LCEL - LangChain Expression Language)
*   Agents (Decision-making loop, Tools, ReAct, Planning)
*   Tools (Functions agents can use, Toolkits)
*   Memory (Adding state to chains/agents)
*   Retrieval (RAG - Connecting to external data)

## LearnLM 1.5 Prompt: LangChain Learning Plan

*Copy and paste the following prompt into a powerful LLM like Google's LearnLM 1.5 (or similar advanced model) to generate a personalized learning plan.*

**Prompt:**

"Act as an expert AI curriculum designer specializing in Agentic AI development. I am a developer with experience in [Specify your primary language: Python or JavaScript/TypeScript] and a basic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) and APIs.

My goal is to become proficient in using the **LangChain** framework ([Specify Python or JS/TS version]) to build sophisticated AI agents capable of complex reasoning, tool use, and interaction with external data sources.

Please generate a structured, step-by-step learning plan for me. The plan should cover:

1.  **Foundational Concepts:** Key LangChain abstractions (Models, Prompts, Chains, Agents, Tools, Memory, LCEL).
2.  **Core Components:** Deep dives into the most important modules for agent development.
3.  **Practical Implementation:** Hands-on tutorials and exercises, starting simple and increasing in complexity.
4.  **Agent Architectures:** Building different types of agents (e.g., ReAct, Plan-and-Execute).
5.  **Tool Integration:** Defining and using custom tools, integrating with external APIs.
6.  **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Using LangChain for building agents that can query external knowledge bases.
7.  **Debugging and Evaluation:** Techniques for understanding and improving agent performance (mentioning LangSmith integration is a plus).
8.  **Project Ideas:** Suggest 2-3 small project ideas to solidify learning.
9.  **Resource Mapping:** Link specific learning objectives to the best official LangChain documentation pages, tutorials, or key YouTube videos where possible.

Structure the plan logically, perhaps as a sequence of topics or a weekly schedule. Emphasize practical coding exercises and building functional agentic components. Assume I have access to standard LLM APIs (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini)."
